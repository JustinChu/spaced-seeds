# Spaced Seed Design
There are many heuristics for spaced seed design. However, most of these methods are not good for designing large spaced seeds (around $k=60$ and $w=20).

My undergraduate directed studies project examined if Shannon entropy can be used as an approximation for spaced seed quality for database searching, particularily when using [BioBloom tools](https://github.com/bcgsc/biobloom).
